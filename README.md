# Inventory-Optimization-Deterministic-Time-Varying-Demand
This Python repository implements simulations for inventory optimization strategies, including Wagnerâ€“Whitin (the Optimal Dynamic lot-size model), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Silver-Meal (SM). The simulations allow users to explore the impact of demand variability on total inventory costs, comparing different ordering policies.
